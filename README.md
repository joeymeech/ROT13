# ROT13
A simple script that encrypts/decrypts user text using the ROT13 cipher!
This is one of the most basic ciphers, actually since there are 13 rotations and there are 26 letters.

26/2 is obviously 13. So you use the same algorithm for encrypting and decrypting. You can make this ciper a little bit better by rotating the letters a different amount then 13.
This would make decrypting slightly more difficult.
